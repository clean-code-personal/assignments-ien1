# Fail the test

Tests are passing even if the code is buggy! **WAIT!** Do not make the code work.

Strenthen the test to fail a defective implementation.

A successful test fails this assignment!

While you are strenthening the test:

- Does the test express what a consumer would want?
- Do you see assumptions becoming explicit?
- Any situations uncovered?
- Do you need higher skills to write the test?
- Do you enjoy it?
